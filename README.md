# Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS)

 # Introduction
 
Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS) are a vital part of the modern smart grid infrastructure, designed to enhance the reliability, stability, and situational awareness of electrical power systems. Unlike 

traditional SCADA systems that provide data at lower resolutions and with delays, WAMS leverages Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) to deliver high-resolution, time-synchronized measurements across geographically 

dispersed locations.

PMUs enable real-time observation of the dynamic state of the power grid, including voltage, current, and phase angle measurements. By using GPS-based time-stamping, WAMS provides a synchronized view of the power

system, which is essential for monitoring system oscillations, detecting disturbances, and preventing blackouts.
